.SH DESCRIPTION
     The sh utility is the standard command interpreter	for the	system.	 The
     current version of	sh is close to the IEEE	Std 1003.1 ("POSIX.1") speci-
     fication for the shell.  It only supports features	designated by POSIX,
     plus a few	Berkeley extensions.  This man page is not intended to be a
     tutorial nor a complete specification of the shell.
.SH AUTHORS
This version of sh was originally written by Alejandro Arbelaez Giraldo and Juan Sebastian Ocampo Hoyos from Holberton School.
